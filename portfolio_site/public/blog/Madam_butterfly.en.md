# Empire, Flower, and Butterfly

"One fine day we'll notice
a thread of smoke arising
on the sea, in the far horizon,
and then the ship appearing;
then the trim white vessel
glides into the harbour, thunders forth her cannon.

See you? Now he is coming!
I do not go to meet him. Not I.
I stay upon the brow of the hillock, and wait there,
and wait for a long time, but never weary
of the long waiting.

From out the crowded city there is coming
a man, a little speck
in the distance, climbing the hillock.

Can you guess who it is?
And when he's reached the summit,
can you guess what he'll say?
He will call: "Butterfly" from the distance.
I, without answ'ring,
hold myself quietly conceal'd.
A bit to tease him and a bit so as to not die
at our first meeting; and then, a little troubled,
he will call, he will call:
"Dear baby wife of mine,
dear little orange blossom!"
The names he used to call me when he came here."

Cio-Cio-San (the real name of Butterfly in Puccini’s opera), a Japanese girl from the Meiji era, waited with all her faith for the return of that American “husband.” The piece Un bel dì vedremo is not only an aria — it is the spiritual center of the whole opera: waiting, belief, and a promise destined to never be fulfilled.

### The fall of the samurai
In 1853, U.S. Commodore Matthew C. Perry led four Black Ships into Uraga and forced the Shogunate to open Japan$^1$. The Tokugawa Shogunate had ruled for nearly 260 years, but the global situation was extremely unfavorable for Japan:
Western powers were far stronger — U.S. Black Ships were over six times larger than Japanese ships; China had just suffered a crushing defeat in the First Opium War and was forced into unequal treaties; and the Shogunate system was decentralized, making major reforms nearly impossible to execute$^2$.

The Black Ship arrival became the final blow. The Shogunate’s authority quickly disintegrated, regional domains intervened in national politics, the slogan of “Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians” surged, and ultimately, the Boshin War broke out between 1867–1868, ending Tokugawa rule. In 1868, the Meiji Emperor proclaimed the Meiji Restoration. The new government then reorganized social classes, abolished the old currency system, replaced domains with prefectures, and eventually stripped the samurai of their hereditary status. Under the Sword Abolishment Edict and intense Westernization, centuries of samurai tradition collapsed in a very short time.

The story of Butterfly takes place in the late 19th to early 20th century, after this rapid transformation. Cio-Cio-San’s father — a samurai — was ordered to die by the state because of the sudden shift of the era. As the daughter of a ruined samurai family with no income, she was sold into a geisha house at fifteen. With no way left to support herself, her life became performing for guests — singing, dancing, entertaining, receiving, and hosting feasts — her last means of survival.

### Meiji Restoration & Americans
From 1870–1890, Japanese law did not legally recognize formal marriages between Japanese citizens and Westerners. So a new type of “legal but commercial” contract relationship emerged:
Foreign men pay money → sign a marriage contract document → gain the right to live together and receive “wife services” → but are not required to obligate.

Put simply:
This was a deal, not a marriage.

Meiji Restoration brought a massive shock — the old world collapsed, but the new one had not formed yet. The Meiji Government absorbed and pushed Western ideas — freedom, rights, individuals, equality, civilization, barbarism — all at once into society within just ten years (1868–1878). For ordinary people, it was a blank space of identity and culture: samurai were stripped of class status, family structures lost support; Western “love, individual, family, self” became newspaper and literature buzzwords; while the deeply rooted patriarchal order still demanded chastity and obedience from women. Cio-Cio-San’s story takes place exactly inside this rupture. To her, love, America, civilization, family, class rising, all became one single symbol — Pinkerton.

She was legally “bought” through contract, but her belief was the purest kind: He is my husband. This marriage is real.

In the opera, the matchmaker said:
“Everything, all of it, only cost 100 yen.”

Based on economic data at that time:
- Japan (~1900): hired laborer average wage 0.3–0.4 yen/day$^3$
- U.S. (~1900): adult male average wage 11.16 USD/week$^4$
- Both countries were under the Gold Standard:
    - 1 yen = 0.75 g pure gold
    - 1 USD = 1.504 g pure gold

So by gold-based exchange calculation, 100 yen ≈ 50 USD, roughly equal to 5 weeks of an average American man’s wage.
Pinkerton was a U.S. naval officer with the rank Lieutenant — a Lieutenant (US Navy) — earning around 23–35 USD a week$^5$, so to him, 100 yen was nothing more than a casual throw. And it is exactly because he did not care, that he could say: “I can tear up this contract anytime.” “A carefree American, running around the world, doing business, enjoying life.”

Puccini repeatedly introduces the theme melody of the American national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner, when Pinkerton makes his entrance. This is, of course, not a decorative choice, not something added for aesthetics — it is a musical statement:
- What appears on stage is not a lover, but an empire.

The anthem recurs throughout the opera, becoming the dominant motif symbolizing the power of the American nation. And these bright, solemn, imperial sounds are then tied to Pinkerton’s careless and irresponsible dialogue. The grandeur of the music against the shallowness of the man creates a sharp, almost painful contrast. From that moment on, Madama Butterfly is no longer only a personal love tragedy — it becomes a concentrated representation of civilization, empire, and the colonial contract relationship itself.

### Love and Death

--Love duet--
To Cio-Cio-San, love was never an emotion — it was a solemn vow. When she said, “I changed my faith,” it wasn’t just religious conversion from Shinto to Christianity. It meant she handed her life over for Pinkerton to decide: Who he is defines who I become. After all, just a fifteen-year-old girl still holding the purest expectations toward this world.

In Madama Butterfly, the love duet at the end of Act 1, Viene la sera (“Night Falls”), and the death trio near the end of Act 3, Io so che alle pene (literally: “I know she is suffering”), stand as the two most crucial turning points of the entire opera. One is enchanting, romantic in tone and harmony. The other is heartbreaking, tragic to the bone. They echo each other — beginning with love sealed like a promise, ending with death delivered like a consequence.

In this duet, the orchestration paints the night scene with incredible detail. At the beginning, the maid Suzuki helps Butterfly out of her layered white kimono as the orchestra unfolds a soft, hazy “nightfall” theme. The cello carries a long, unbroken four-bar phrase, stretching wide like a breeze slipping through the dark, while a lone nightingale call flickers in the background. It’s breathtakingly beautiful.

At this point, the melodic line is held mostly by the orchestra, and the characters speak only in low, quiet exchanges. As the duet moves into its second section, the musical idea shifts into the B theme, where Cio-Cio-San and Pinkerton begin singing to each other with deep, earnest emotion. The rhythm and melody turn steady, clear, almost perfectly shaped. Puccini lets this theme repeat twice, lifting both voices little by little, line by line, building emotion into a tidal rise, right before delivering the famous climax, “Vogliatemi bene” — please, love me well.

At the end, the duet reaches a radiant peak as the two voices join in octave harmony, closing in a full, polished cadence in F-major — bright, ringing, complete.

The music grows out of A-major, but then, almost strangely, ends in F-major, a third away. That surprising tonal shift, paired with the final hopeful sixth-chord, wraps their love in a dreamlike glow — magical, hopeful, but maybe a little unreal.

This love duet captures the sweetest emotional high for Cio-Cio-San: a wedding feast faded into night, the young newlyweds left alone together for the first time, whispering vows under starlight, swearing forever in half-spoken promises. For the audience, it’s a romantic finale — a neat, glowing, “happily-ever-after” finish to Act I, offering a surge of romantic satisfaction, even as it quietly sets the stage for tragedy — because we already know Pinkerton is playing a game he will eventually walk away from.

That’s why this unbearably beautiful duet feels like glass, glowing and fragile. To Cio-Cio-San, this night is love turned into belief, love poured out like a creed. But to fate, it’s just the calm before the storm — elegant, glowing, irresistible, and heartbreakingly short.

-- Humming Bird --
Cio-Cio-San quietly waits for Pinkerton — waits for love, waits for a sunrise, “Our love is quiet and restrained, yet as broad and deep as the ocean.” She sees the arrival of Pinkerton’s American Navy ship, but she does not rush toward him — not into a passionate embrace, not into fervent kisses. Instead, she kneels and sits inside the room, staying awake all night, silently crying and waiting.
As the audience, we already know that only heartbreak and death are approaching. Yet every time this scene plays out, I can’t help but feel moved, brought to tears. Human emotion is just that beautiful.

-- Chi Sia? Who is it? --
“Three years have passed. She scans every ship that enters the harbor, searching its color, its flag.”
This is the tragedy at its highest point. To me, it is the most heartbreaking moment in the entire opera — sweet in the way a child waits for her mother to come home, yet we already know: what arrives is not an embrace, but the end that has been waiting for her all along.

-- Death Trio -- 
In Act III, the trio “Io so che alle sue pene” marks the moment when the tragedy fully detonates.

After the long wait, dawn has finally broken. Pinkerton returns to Nagasaki with his American wife Kate and the consul Sharpless. When Pinkerton sees the blooming flowers filling the room and the home that Butterfly has carefully adorned to welcome him, he at last realizes the bitter consequences of his own actions.

The music shifts sharply into something dim and heavy. The orchestra plays uneasy chords in low trumpet and cello, as if casting shadows across the morning light. On stage now are Pinkerton, Sharpless, and Suzuki. A dense and complicated vocal texture unfolds — Sharpless (baritone) tries calmly to persuade Suzuki to agree to hand the child over to be raised by Pinkerton and Kate; Suzuki (mezzo-soprano) cannot conceal her grief, pleading almost in sobs, her voice trembling with despair; Pinkerton (tenor), drowning in guilt, cannot bring himself to face Cio-Cio-San, slipping into broken, choked fragments of monologue:
“Oh! How bitter this familiar fragrance of flowers has become…”

</video>

In terms of harmony, the trio makes frequent use of dissonant chords and chromatic motion, rising and falling by semitone, slowly pushing upward and downward. When the emotions of the three voices knot together, the orchestra underneath erupts into sharp harmonic clashes, intensifying the suffocating tension of the moment. Sharpless strikes the core of the tragedy with a single low sigh: “Io so che alle sue pene non ci sono conforti” (“I know there is no comfort for her pain.”)It cuts straight to the truth — the devotion Cio-Cio-San has given for years has only led her to despair, and no consolation could ever mend the wound that has been inflicted. 
In this act, the sweet “love motive” that once bloomed again and again in Act I can no longer be heard. In its place comes a warped form of it — fractured notes floating briefly, scattered, then fading at once, foreshadowing that even the fragments of a beautiful past will eventually sink into silence.

### Orientalism and Criticism
At the end of the opera, Cio-Cio-San takes the dagger that once caused her father's death by imperial order and ends her own life with it. In her last breath, she hears Pinkerton’s voice and forces herself to rise, arms unfolding like butterfly wings one final time before collapsing — as if her wings have snapped, answering the words Pinkerton once said in Act I: “I must chase her down, even if I have to break her wings.”

Many critiques of Giacomo Puccini’s work — especially Madama Butterfly — tend to begin by placing the opera inside the frame of “the East being watched vs. imperial conquest.” That perspective absolutely has value. It exposes power structures and makes us notice how Western imagination reshapes the East. But if that frame is used as the only lens to summarize the entire story, the interpretation becomes extremely narrow.

Edward Said’s concept of Orientalism$^6$ is strong when analyzing structures of power, but weak when explaining how individuals in a violently ruptured era believe in and rely on a symbolic system to make their own spiritual world make sense. In other words — it can explain the structure, but not the person inside it. Cio Cio San’s tragedy is not simply “a meek geisha vs. a conquering Navy officer,” but a product of Meiji Japan’s rupture — a moment when belief systems cracked too fast for individuals to fill the psychological void left behind. That logic only truly holds when placed back inside the Japanese Empire around 1900.

As mentioned earlier, after the Meiji Restoration, Japanese society reshaped class, currency, identity, mobility, knowledge, and legitimacy at incredible speed. The old belief system collapsed too quickly, and the new ideas rushed in too violently, producing widespread psychological rupture and spiritual emptiness. Butterfly’s longing and waiting are not merely about love — they are the highest possible identity projection she could hold onto amid cultural collision.

To a 15-year-old girl, getting carried away by a brand-new civilization, dazzled by the promises of a symbol that seemed to carry legal legitimacy, rising identity, and a future contract in sound — it is not ridiculous, not childish, not absurd. It is historically logical: when a new symbol carries a promise of identity rise and future legitimacy, it naturally becomes a spiritual exit. She is not written as naïve because she is childish — she is written that way because she is the rupture itself embodied.

Musically, the recurring deformation of rhythmic material in the orchestra comes from The Star-Spangled Banner. It is a musical device — a sonic language that quietly reminds the audience: the force determining her fate is not a lover, but an institution. The melody is not a romantic garnish, but a contract spoken in music: what she has fallen in love with is not an equal partner, but a national symbol — a greater civilization, a legal promise, and an institutional presence in sound.

In the trio in Act III — “Io so che alle sue pene non ci sono conforti” — Sharpless speaks the truth in its lowest, quietest sigh: the devotion she has given for years has no comfort, no way out, and no voice that could ever refill what has been cracked open. What collapses here is not love — it is the symbol itself. And when a symbol collapses, a person whose entire identity was built on it can only confirm it through final action.

Her rejection of a Japanese noble’s proposal in Act II is not a collapse of submission — it is a collapse of conflicting symbolic contracts. In her cognition, the noble embodies feudal/patriarchal concubinage contracts. America, by contrast, projects a civilizational promise — legal protection, rising identity, future legitimacy, and a new kind of marriage contract. She chose not submission, but the highest future symbol she had access to at the time.

So overall:
You can critique Orientalism, yes — but you cannot reduce Butterfly’s waiting, choices, and death to the aesthetic convenience of “Western gaze.” From the beginning, the music tells you: the symbol she grabbed for survival was larger than love, larger than self, larger than a contract one person could carry. The tragedy is not her belief — it is the fact that no belief could ever close the abyss once opened.

And this is where Puccini becomes powerful:
He wrote the romance as moving, but he wrote fate even deeper — institutional presence, national contracts, symbolic collapse, louder, darker, and more beautiful than love itself.
